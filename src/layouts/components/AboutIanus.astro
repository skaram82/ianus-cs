      </div>
      <div class="mt-6 lg:col-6 lg:mt-0">
        <p class="pb-2">The IANUS project strengthens warranted trust in science, research and innovation at a systemic level by encouraging participation in research as a co-creative and inclusive process, sensitive to societal values, concerns and needs. Value-driven research means that researchers are engaged and sensitive to societal needs and values, as well as dedicated to helping society deal with urgent global challenges.</p>
        <p class="pb-2">Research often shows weaknesses in societal needs and values, such as inclusiveness and equality, because societal input is limited. Societal stakeholders must become crucial sources of information and inspiration to obtain their active role in the research process. Trust must be inspired by transparency and trustworthiness of knowledge production and established by active participation as part of scienceâ€™s function.</p>
        <p class="pb-2">The acronym IANUS refers to the deity Janus of gateways (ianus in Latin), looking both at the inside and at the outside of the knowledge production process. Trust in science is never a given. Robust trust is well-placed, reciprocal and informed.</p>
