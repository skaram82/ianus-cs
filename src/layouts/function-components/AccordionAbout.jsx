      <AccordionItem id="2" title="Important Information" >
        <p>Below, we give you provide you with some necessary information about the case study we are carrying out as part of the European Project "INspiring and ANchoring TrUst in Science (IANUS)" (No. Contract: 101058158), which is funded by the European Commission (EUROPEAN COMMISSION-Research Executive Agency) and we invite you to participate. Your participation is voluntary. </p>
        <p>You can discuss this study and the consent form with other people, such as family, friends, or anyone you feel comfortable with. You do not have to decide right away. You can decide whether you want to participate in the study after you have thought about it. There may be words you need help understanding or things you would like more details about. You can stop anytime and ask the research coordinators questions.</p>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem id="3" title="Purpose: Why are we conducting this study?" >
        <p>To investigate whether our research hypothesis is correct, however obvious it may seem, we need to test it by following the scientific methodology. We hypothesize that various factors influence the public's trust in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as demographics, digital literacy, scope of application, and the involvement or not of human factors. This research aims to test this hypothesis by conducting a case study that will explore the public's trust in AI for political discourse analysis, given the limitations of these technologies in terms of "illusions" and the spread of misinformation. </p>
        <p>After the end of our study, the researchers will pseudonymize your data so that it becomes impossible to link it to you in any way (i.e., any identifying information will be replaced by a random identifier). The research team will then analyze the pseudonymized data to draw conclusions and provide guidelines for developing regulatory frameworks that will protect the public from potential risks and ensure the responsible use of AI.</p>
      </AccordionItem>
      <AccordionItem id="4" title="Subject Selection: Why are we requesting your participation?" >

      <AccordionItem id="5" title="Your participation is voluntary: Do I have to do this?" >

            <li>You will be asked to use an online platform specifically designed for this case study, where you will be required to rate a small number of tasks based on the degree of trust they inspire in you through specially designed trust measurement instruments.</li>
            <li>You may be asked to participate in an open-ended interview in order to explore in more detail the factors that influence your trust in Generative AI.</li>
